# Calculator
 
This is a basic calculator that I created in Godot 4, based off a tutorial on YouTube:
	Pt. 1 (UI): https://youtu.be/qaMZptkLCvc?si=NdHLST7PJsfXTRw_
	Pt. 2 (Code): https://youtu.be/9PsgpuHj3XI?si=zlyQIfCcvrlEsAgC
In this calculator, you can input numbers by clicking the buttons corresponding with the number.
Then, you can add, subtract, multiply, or divide it with another number by clicking on the corresponding operator button.
You can calculate as many numbers as you would like, and then click on the blue equals button to calculate your answer.
Your previous work will go in a grey area on the top, and under that is your current work, bigger and in white.
You can clear the calculator by using the C button on the top left.
You can negate the number by clicking the negate button to the right of the clear button.
You can delete your inputs by clicking on the button with the left-pointing arrow.
